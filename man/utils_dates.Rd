\title{Date-Related Utilities}
\description{
A collection of date-related utility functions used throughout the
GMH Data Hub application. These functions handle various aspects of
date manipulation, including leasing weeks, pre-lease seasons, and
general date formatting.
}
\details{
Dates are of particular importance in the GMH Data Hub application,
as they are used to calculate leasing weeks, pre-lease seasons, and
other time-based metrics. These functions help ensure consistency
in date calculations and formatting throughout the application.

The functions are grouped into several categories:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Leasing Week}: Functions related to calculating the start and end
dates of a leasing week.
\item \strong{Pre-Lease Season}: Functions for determining the start and end dates
of the pre-lease season.
\item \strong{Leasing Period}: Functions for calculating the start and end dates
of the leasing period.
\item \strong{Weeks Left to Lease}: Determine the number of weeks left to lease
until the start of the next leasing period.
\item \strong{Weekly Period}: Functions for working with weekly periods.
\item \strong{Date Formatting and Coercion}: Functions for formatting and coercing
date strings to Date objects.
}
}
\section{Key Date Concepts}{

\itemize{
\item \strong{Leasing Week}: A period starting on a specific day of the week,
depending on the "reporting cycle" used for leasing-related calculations,
and ending on the day before the next leasing week starts.
\item \strong{Pre-lease Season}: The period during which leasing for the upcoming
academic year typically occurs. For GMH, this is generally September 1st of
the current year through July 31st of the following year.
\item \strong{Leasing Period}: The full duration of a lease, often spanning an
academic year (August 1st through July 31st).
\item \strong{Weekly Period}: A period of seven days, typically used for reporting
purposes.
\item \strong{Entrata Date Format}: The date format used by Entrata, a property
management software used by GMH.
}

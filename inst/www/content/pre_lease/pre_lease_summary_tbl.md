### Overview

This pre-lease summary report provides a comprehensive overview of property leasing performance across multiple managed properties.

It represents pre-lease summary information, offering valuable insights into **occupancy rates**, **leasing trends**, and **year-over-year performance**.

### Data Structure

The dataset includes various pre-leasing related fields, including but not limited to:

- Property Details (e.g., Property Name, Property ID)
- Associated GMH Investment Partner
- Manual Model Beds
- Leasing Information (New Leases, Renewals, Total Leases)
- Pre-Lease % (Current and Prior)
- Year-over-Year (YOY) Variances
- Recent Leasing Activity (Prior Seven Days)
- Remaining Beds Left to Lease
- Velocity Metrics at Difference Occupancy Levels (e.g., 90%, 95%, 100%)

#### Key Metrics

The following key metrics are displayed:
      
- **Current Pre-lease %**: Shows the percentage of beds currently leased for the upcoming term
- **Prior Pre-lease %**: Displays the leasing percentage from the same time last year
- **YOY Change**: Indicates the year-over-year improvement or decline in leasing performance
- **Beds Left**: Shows the current available inventory for each property

### Key Observations

1. **Occupancy Rates**: Most properties show high occupancy rates, with several at or near 100%. Notable exceptions include 1047 Commonwealth Avenue (66.12%) and The Caswell at Runnymeade (76.52%).
2.  **Pre-lease Performance**: Many properties have achieved or exceeded 100% pre-lease rates.Academy 65 stands out with a 102.91% pre-lease rate, indicating overbooking.
3.  **Year-over-Year Comparisons**: Properties like Academy 65 and The Caswell at Runnymeade show significant improvements in pre-lease percentages compared to the prior year.Some properties, like 1047 Commonwealth Avenue, show a decline in pre-lease performance.
4.  **Leasing Mix**: There's a varied mix of new leases and renewals across properties.Some properties heavily favor new leases (e.g., The Caswell at Runnymeade), while others have a more balanced distribution.
5.  **Inventory Status**: Several properties are fully leased or overbooked.Properties like The Dean Reno and Venue at North Campus still have significant inventory available.
6.  **Velocity Metrics**: These metrics (vel_90, vel_95, vel_100) provide insights into the speed of leasing at different occupancy levels.Negative values indicate a slowdown in leasing velocity as occupancy increases.
